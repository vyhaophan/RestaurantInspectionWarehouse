# RestaurantInspectionWarehouse
This is my project at school. A data warehouse of New York's restaurants inspection activities was built.

The overall schema for this warehouse is as following picture:

**This project includes 3 parts:**

*The 1st part is SSIS*. In this part, I used SQL server, Visual Studio, Oracle commands to divide the original dataset into 4 dimension tables and 1 fact table.

*The 2nd part is SSAS* (analysis). I used Visual Studio, Excel to query many things out of the warehouse, also made some Pivot tables in Excel.

*The 3rd part is SSRS* (reporting). I used Visual Studio's Reporting Service, Microsoft Power BI to make dashboards.
